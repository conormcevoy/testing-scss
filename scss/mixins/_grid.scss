/**
 Builds the grid rules for a specific breakpoint.

 If the breakpoint is not null, a proper suffix is created and the rules applied
 with it. If it is null, then no suffix is added. This is helpful to define
 default values with no special regard to different viewports.

 @example Create default grid. For a 20% column size, it generates `-x20`
 and `-offset-20` rules.

   ```
   @include grid-at-breakpoint();
